.TH 8-PUZZLE-SOLVER 1 "February 10, 2023" "Version 1.2.0" "User Manual"
.SH NAME
8-puzzle-solver \- a puzzle solving app that allows you to specify the initial and goal state of the board of a 8 puzzle game.
.SH SYNOPSIS
8-puzzle-solver
.SH DESCRIPTION
Unlike other apps that solve the 8-puzzle, this app allows you to specify the final state of the board and the goal state. The search tree is developed with the A* algorithm, giving the least expensive solution (talking about the number of moves).
.SH USAGE
The solver expects two inputs (initial and final states of the board) as a string. For example, the string "123456780" (Obviously without the quotes "") will represent the following board:

.PP
.TS
tab(@);
c c c .
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 0
.TE

.PP
Then the solver will show the initial and final states of the board that were specified, the exact path from the given start to the solution with each step depth and some search info like CREATED_NODES, EXPANDED_NODES and SOLUTION_DEPTH.
.SH OPTIONS
No options are currently supported.
.SH SEE ALSO
No related manuals are available.
.SH BUGS
The following is not a bug, but the user must be aware of the following information: When the app requests the initial and final states of the board, if the user decides to enter anything other than a complete number string, the app will crash and terminate. This 'failure' will remain in the app as it is assumed that the user knows what input is required.
